🎮 Usage Examples
Basic Processing
typescriptimport { processTranscript } from './src/pipeline';

const result = await processTranscript(
"I feel overwhelmed with work and need some guidance"
);

console.log(result.response_text);
// Output: "🌱 Take it step by step, you've got this 💪"
Web API Usage
bash# Process a new transcript
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/process \
